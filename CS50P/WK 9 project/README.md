** Video Demo: https://youtu.be/bw0neuk2qw4 **
 Description: Have you ~~contended~~ struggled with picking up new vocabularies? Do you have a list of words that you are too ~~indolent~~ lazy to search up on individually?<br />Fret not because the Vocabulary Notebook can solve all your problem! Simply enter the list of words, separated by spaces, into the command-line and the Vocabulary Notebook will look for all the definitions! You can even save the definitions to a csv file.You no longer have to laboriously type in individual words into you browser and crtl+c, crtl+v the defintions and examples into a word document. With a click of a button, the words searched will be saved into a csv file.<br />In the command-line, enter "project.py contended indolent" to test the project. Alternatively, you can look up any word by entering "project.py word1 word2 ...".<br />How does the program work? The program will access Merriam-Webster's free API to look up the defintion of the words. Next, it will parse the JSON response and output the result in Pandas dataframe. The user will then have the option to convert and save the dataframe as a csv file. <br />Note: There are some Python modules which have to be installed as specified in requirements.txt.<br />P.S. the API is free and hence there is a daily limit of 1,000 words which can be accessed.
